## Summmary

I had very limited time to play this CTF, but I was able to solve 6 out of 61 challenges. I solved challenges in the categories; `Web`, `Pwn` and `Reversing`.

I have been trying to improve my binary explotation skills lately, so the `Pwn` challenges was fun for this CTF. The `Web` challenges were also good, because I got to do a few techniques that I haven't used much before.
